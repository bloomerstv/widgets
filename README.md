This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Dependencies Note

This project intentionally uses React 18.2.0 and does not upgrade to React 19.0.0 due to the following dependency constraints:

- `interweave@13.1.0` requires `react@^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`
- Upgrading to React 19.0.0 would break compatibility with `interweave`

```bash
# Current working versions
"react": "18.2.0",
"react-dom": "18.2.0"
```
